New # Pink-Hills-Qtile-Config
Config files for my Pink Hills Linux build

GTK themes are hard to upload, so I've left them out. The themes I have used are:

[GTK-Icons](https://www.gnome-look.org/s/Gnome/p/1463720/)
[GTK-Theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1521400/)

Colours from the termite config can be subbed into these themes to match the rice
